# HassioKakuBlasterCtrl
Control Kakublaster from home assistant

This config assumes you have php capable webserver running on the same machine
connected to the kakublaster usb dongle.

Just look for "LAMP setup <Osname>".

1. Compile+ install the Kakusend application and put it on the machine with the webserver.
2. Add the .php file to the webserver running on the machine connected to the kaku blaster
3. Add .yaml files to the homeassistant config. (and reboot hassio)
